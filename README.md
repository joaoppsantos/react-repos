This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

$ npm install
```

Allows us to install the dependencies needed to run the project.

## Usage

In order to run the app, you just need to use:

```sh

```

And the application will open on: http://localhost:3000/.

## Next Steps
